Today there is an the exponential increase in the number 3G/4G enabled devices. A cell
tower can support only a limited number of 3G/4G connection at a given time. This limitation of mobile technology leads to degraded service quality for customers at social gathering. WiFi is a solution to the problem as it can support large number of clients compared to Cellular data. Using WiFi to serve cellular clients is known as 3G Wifi Offloading[1]. Authentication over Wifi is a challenge though. This document describes the Extensible Authentication Protocol and several of its best-known security issues. This protocol is widely used for authentication over Wireless Networks. The document also introduces the basic functionality of EAP for Subscriber Identity Module(SIM) and discusses several of it's vulnerabilities. It later discusses possible improvements to avoid attacks of EAP-SIM.
