\chapter{Security Issues}

EAP is a standard that provides an infrastructure for network access clients and authentication servers. EAP does not specify the authentication mechanism itself but the way it is negotiated by the communicating parties. Consequently, EAP has no security issues in itself. In contrast, each EAP implementation stipulates some specific valid authentication methods. Consequently, EAP implementations may furnish with security vulnerabilities. The following section summarize security issues associated EAP.

\section{EAP-SIM Weakness}
EAP-SIM is designed to provide security enhancements to the GSM authentication, it does not meet its
security goals. If an attacker wants to authenticate himself to a mobile user and impersonate an AAA server, the only thing that he has to do is to generate a valid keyed MAC using a K-auth key. A valid MAC can be generated by possessing two or three Kc keys and the related RAND parameters of GSM authentication triplets, which can be obtained with one of the following ways:
1. Having physical access to a SIM card, it is easy to obtain any parameter of GSM triplets.
2. Using virus or other malicious piece of software, an adversary may mount an attack on the user platform in
order to obtain triplets.  
3. If the same SIM credentials are also used for GSM traffic, the triplets could be revealed in the GSM network.
4. An attacker could gain access to the communication between the AuC and the AAA server in the EAP-SIM
authentication dialogue.
Thus, if eventually multiple GSM triplets are compromised;then, an adversary may impersonate a valid network and start an authentication session with the mobile user. The attacker can calculate a valid hashed MAC, as he possesses the RAND parameters, and he can generate the K-auth from the encryption keys Kc. Since there is no way for the user to understand that there is an attack, he authenticates the attacker as a legitimate network, based on the received valid MAC.
The compromised GSM triplets can be used by an adversary to perform attacks as long as the permanent key Ki, which is employed to produce the triplets, remains the same and this could be for years. This is one example of attacks. 
There are two other type of attacks on EAP-SIM which we will discuss in more detail.

\section{Figures}

Figure~\ref{fig:encrypted_virus} has been typeset so that it
occupies half the width of text on a page ({\tt width=0.5}). Note the 
symbolic cross-reference, that is, you simple \verb+\ref{fig:encrypted_virus}+
to obtain the appropriate number for Figure~\ref{fig:encrypted_virus}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/encrypted_virus.jpg}
\caption{Encrypted virus before and after decryption.} 
\label{fig:encrypted_virus}
\end{figure}

If you move things around, insert or delete text, Figure~\ref{fig:encrypted_virus}
will still give you the correct number. This is a very handy feature.


\section{Tables}

Table~\ref{tab:19} 
shows some interesting stuff. I hope you enjoy it.

\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{MysteryTwister Zodiac Challenge\label{tab:19}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|lc}\hline\hline
Case & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Description} & Percentage\\ \hline
1F & Fast outer hill climb and English stats & 13.00\% \\
1S & Slow outer hill climb and English stats & \phantom{0}4.00\% \\
2F & Fast outer hill climb and Zodiac~408 stats & 70.00\% \\
2S & Slow outer hill climb and Zodiac~408 stats & 84.00\% \\ \hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section{Citations}

References are cited using the \verb+\cite+ command. For example,
see~\cite{harden} for information on the Zodiac killer. You can include more than one 
reference in a single citation, like this~\cite{harden,bib1,basa,bib3,bib2,glurk,bib7,bib10,bib11}
or this~\cite{bibAC,bib17}.


\section{The Last Word}

There are a lot of other uses for symbolic cross-referencing. For example, this chapter
title has a label so I can refer to Chapter~\ref{chap:blah} (as I just did).
My recommendation is that you include a label with anything and everything that 
is numbered. If it has a number, there is a good chance that you will
refer to it at some point.

Finally, note that you need to \LaTeX\ a file at least twice (three times to
be safe) without changing anything to be sure that the numbering is correct.
Why is that? Good question.
When you \LaTeX\ your document, various auxiliary files are created. Most of these files contain
information related to cross-references that appear in your {\tt .tex} file (or files). The next time you 
\LaTeX\ your document, the information from the previous run is read from
these auxiliary files. Consequently, after making changes to any {\tt .tex}
file, you will need to \LaTeX\ your document at least twice to be sure that the
cross-reference information is updated in the resulting pdf. In fact, you should
run \LaTeX\ three consecutive times to be certain that cross-references are correct.
